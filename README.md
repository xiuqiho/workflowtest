## Team P4-5's Workflow
## Rules
Any changes to the repository MUST be first done on a `ui/<feature_name>`, `backend/<feature_name>`, or `documentation/<feature_name>` branch, before merging it with `dev` branch, followed by `main` branch
### Issue Management
1. An issue **MUST** be created for each assigned feature
2. Issues for feature components are **ADVICED** to be created to help with tracking feature progress
3. Issues **MUST** be assigned to **at least ONE** team member
4. Issues **MUST** be given an appropriate label (e.g. `UI` / `backend` / `documentation`)
5. Issues **MUST** be assigned to the `M3` milestone
6. Issues **MUST NOT** be closed until corresponding feature is completed and merged with `dev` or `main` branch
### Feature Branch Management
1. Features **MUST** have a corresponding branch created for it
- `ui/<ui_feature_name>` for Web UI related features
- `backend/<backend_feature_name>` for backend code related features
- `management/<management_feature_name>` for project / repo management related features (e.g. README.md changes)
2. Pushes to feature branch should only be done after completing a **WORKING** version of the feature component / feature
### Development Branch Management
1. Only **COMPLETED** `ui`, `backend`, or `management` feature branches can be merged into the `dev` branch
2. Pull Requests (PR) to merge should be done through GitHub's web UI
3. Pull Requests should be created by assigning exactly 4 other team mates for review and approval
4. Final action to merge the feature branch with `dev` branch **MUST** be done by the PR initiater after receiving all 4 approvals
### Main Branch Management
1. Only `dev` branch can be merged into the `main` branch
2. Pull Requests (PR) to merge should be done through GitHub's web UI
3. Pull Requests should be created by the **_Team Lead_** and assigned to exactly 4 other team mates for review and approval
4. Final action to merge the feature branch with `dev` branch **MUST** be done by the **_Team Lead_** after receiving all 4 approvals

## Standard Operating Procedures (SOP)
### I. Starting an Assigned Feature
1. Create **HIGH-priority** issue on team's GitHub project board
2. Create corresponding type of feature branch based off current `dev` branch
```bash
# Creating a new `ui` feature
git checkout -b ui/<ui_feature_name> dev

# Creating a new `backend` feature
git checkout -b backend/<backend_feature_name> dev

# Creating a new `management` feature
git checkout -b management/<management_feature_name> dev
```
3. After making initial changes, create this new feature branch on GitHub repo
```bash
# Commit the newly created feature branch with a meaningful message
git commit -am "initial commit for <feature_type>/<feature_name> branch"

# Push the newly created feature branch onto GitHub repo
git push --set-upstream origin <feature_type>/<feature_name>
```
### II. Save Feature progress
1. Commit and push **WORKING** version of feature with newly added component (do this the moment a feature component is deemed completed)
```bash
# Commit changes with a meaningful commit message
git commit -am "[ADDED]|[REMOVED]|[MODIFIED] <feature>'s <feature_component> ..."

# Push changes into corresponding feature branch on GitHub repo
git push
```
### III. Merging a Completed Feature branch with Development branch
1. Go to `https://github.com/team-p4-5/ICT2101-p4-5/pulls` in a web browser
2. Click on the `New pull request` button
3. Select `dev` in the `base:___` dropdown list
4. Select corresponding feature branch in the `compare:___` dropdown list
5. Click on the `Create pull request` button
6. Input meaningful PR **_title_** and **_comment_**
7. Select 4 reviewers aside from yourself under `Reviewers` settings
8. Assign yourself under `Assignees` settings
9. Assign `Labels` according to the type of the feature involved in this PR
10. Assign the PR to the corresponding `ICT2101/2201 Team Project` project and `M3` milestone
11. Click on the `Create pull request` button
12. Once all 4 approvals have been given, click on the `Merge pull request` button on the newly created PR's page
13. Input meaningful merge **_title_** and **_message_**
14. Click on the `Confirm merge` button
15. Close the corresponding issue for the feature

### IV. Merging Development branch with Main branch
1. Go to `https://github.com/team-p4-5/ICT2101-p4-5/pulls` in a web browser
2. Click on the `New pull request` button
3. Select `main` in the `base:___` dropdown list
4. Select `dev` in the `compare:___` dropdown list

12. Input meaningful merge **_title_** and **_message_**
13. Click on the `Confirm merge` button


### V. Making changes / hotfixes to a completed Feature (closed issue)
1. Create a **HIGH-priority** [HOTFIX] issue on team's GitHub project board
2. Upon completing the hotfix implementation, commit and push **WORKING** version of feature
```bash
# Commit changes with a meaningful commit message
git commit -am "[HOTFIX] <feature>'s <feature_component> ..."

# Push changes into corresponding feature branch on GitHub repo
git push
```
3. Perform Procedure (III) for merging hotfixed feature branch into dev
